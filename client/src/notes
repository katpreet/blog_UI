We can convert each component to a class component.
As of now i have made them function components because i am handling data through the redux store.

To access data of the store from function component , we use props.users.name
To access data of the store from class component, we use this.props.users.name

All the data is getting loaded into the store from index page (i.e the very first time the app starts)
When this data gets loaded on startup ...the redux store gets populated

If any specific data is required related to one user or one post, we use MapstatetoProps.
In this we "filter" in case we need multiple records. Here we get the array of objects that match the 
condition and we cannot use it directly. this data has to be iterated and used using maps as:
this.props.users.map......
and we "find" in case we need single record. (here we get the object) and we can use the data directly As
{this.user.name}
